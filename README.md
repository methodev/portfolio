This document represents my professional portfolio. It includes a selective part of both personal and assigned works which I had the honor to be part of and the opportunity to grow through them.

All projects differ in substance, assigners, complexity and requirements. They have been developed in times of changing web technologies (2008 — 2017). Some of them, though outdated, are still functional, while others have been modified or replaced by newer versions.
